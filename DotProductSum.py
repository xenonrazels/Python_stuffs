#We can use the concept of tranpose of matrix and then multiplying inorder to find  the sum of dot products
#   i=1                  T     # here T => Transpose
#    âˆ‘  X*Y       is    X * Y for this we take value as a matrix form
#   n=5  i i     
# This concept is useful in perceptron training in deep neural nets
